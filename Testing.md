Software used: **Eclipse + JUnit 5 plugin** </br>

In order to run the test (assuming you are using Eclipse IDE):
1. Open the file **KnapsackTest**
2. Go to **Run As** -> **JUnit Test**

For testing, I implemented a unit test using the **JUnit 5 plugin** (for Eclipse IDE).
The test case takes as input two pre-defined arrays and compares them with the expectedResult[] in order to test
the **Profit()** method.
