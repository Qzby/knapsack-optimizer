**Instructions** (How to unpack, build and execute the knapsack-optimizer solution) </br>

In order to run the knapsack-optimizer solution please start by cloning the repo on your local machine. </br>

You can choose to run the solution by: </br>

**1.  Using your favorite IDE (I was using Eclipse IDE).** </br>
* Make sure you have the latest JDK installed. </br>
* Go to **File** -> **Open File** -> ./Knapsack-optimizer/solution/Knapsack.java. </br>
* Also used for running the Unit test I've implemented (**KnapsackTest.java**) in order to test one of the methods used in the solution part. </br>

**2.  Using the command line (I used GitBash).** </br>
* Navigate to the solution folder: ./Knapsack-optimizer/solution </br>
* Run: **$ java Knapsack** </br>

**3.  Run the solution as a containerized application. I used Docker as it's one of the most used tools for building containers.** 
* In the solution folder, I created a Dockerfile with all the info needed for building and running the solution inside a container. </br>
* Make sure Docker is installed on your OS. </br>
* Open the command line and navigate to the solution folder: ./Knapsack-optimizer/solution </br>
* Run: **$ docker build -t knapsack .** </br>
* The "docker build" command builds an image from the Dockerfile. </br>
* After the build was successful type: **$ docker run -i knapsack**  </br>
* The "docker run" command will tell Docker to run the solution as a process inside an isolated container. </br>
